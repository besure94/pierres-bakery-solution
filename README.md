## Description

This application allows users to order bread and/or pastries from a bakery. Users will be prompted with a welcome message upon running the application, and presented with the cost for a single loaf of bread and pastry. They will also be presented with deals for each option, with a 'Buy 2, get 1 free' deal for bread and a 'Buy 3, get 1 free' deal for pastries. Users can specify how many loaves of bread and pastries they would like, and the application will return the total cost of the order. The user can then place another order, or exit the application.
